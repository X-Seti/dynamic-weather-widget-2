## Apologies (again)
Laptop issues, Covid, and overtime meant I've not been able to do much development on this widget recently.
At some point the laptop will need to go away for repair, so it might go very quiet around here for a while...

## About this widget
This is an updated version of the "plasma-applet-weather-widget" by Kotelnik, but using the Met.No API instead of the Yr.No API which is no longer operational.

## Installation Instructions, and Documentation

I am just a hobbyist / enthusiastic amateur - I'm sure a professional Javascript / QML programmer will be horrified with my code! So bug reports, suggestions, code polishes and bugfixes are welcome - as are translations (as Google Translate may not have been entirely accurate)!
